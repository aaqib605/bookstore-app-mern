# Bookstore App - MERN Stack

This is a Bookstore App built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack.

## Installation

To install all the dependencies, run the following commands in both the frontend and backend directories:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

## Configuration

Before running the app, make sure to update the MongoDB connection string in the backend/config.js file. Replace the existing URL with your own MongoDB URL, which will be provided when you create your database.

## Backend Server

To start the backend server, navigate to the backend directory and run:

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

## Frontend Server

To start the frontend server, navigate to the backend directory and run:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Now, you should have both the backend and frontend servers up and running for your Bookstore app.
